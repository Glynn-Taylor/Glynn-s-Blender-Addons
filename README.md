## Lowpoly Tools
A collection of tools for vertex color based art:
* Multiply vertex color layers together
* Set vertex color of selected vertices instead of faces
* Multiply selected vertices by color
* Set selected vertices to greyscale
* Add noise to selected vertices
* Desaturate / saturate selected vertices
* Lighten / Darken selected vertices

I'm thinking of adding something to select similar coloured vertices with a tolerance, also smoothing across vertices.

## Archviz Tools
A collection of tools for reducing the vert count spread across many many objects:
* Select objects by regular expression
* Apply remove doubles across all selected objects with a customizable merge distance
* Apply a planar dissolve across all selected objects with a customizable angle

I'm thinking of adding something to mass rename objects
